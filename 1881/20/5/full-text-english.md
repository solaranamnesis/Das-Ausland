# About the "Organisms of the Meteorites".

## By Anton Rzehak in Brünn.

When Dr. Otto Hahn's work "The Meteorite and its Organisms" came into my hands last year I was well aware of the importance that the detection of unquestionable organisms in meteorites would have for cosmology. After reading the above work, however, I had to confess to myself that the proof had not yet been provided with the desirable certainty; I believe I arouse the same opinion in my auditorium when, at the March meeting of the Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn, I spoke about Dr. Hahn's work.
