# About the "Organisms of the Meteorites".

## By Anton Rzehak in Brünn.

When Dr. Otto Hahn's work "The Meteorite and its Organisms" came into my hands last year I was well aware of the importance that the detection of unquestionable organisms in meteorites would have for cosmology. After reading the above work, however, I had to confess to myself that the proof had not yet been provided with the desirable certainty; I believe I arouse the same opinion in my auditorium when, at the March meeting of the Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn, I spoke about Dr. Hahn's work.

I did not originally intend to announce in this way the view that I had formed about the "organisms" of the meteorites; I thought to myself that the professional circles would, anyway, form their independent judgement and lay people would rarely get their hands on Hahn's book because of its high price due to its furnishings. I am prompted by the article published in No. 16 of this journal by Dr. Fr. Weinland under the title "Corals in the Meteorites".

The only criticism of Hahn's work that has come to my attention thus far is the one come up with by the French Academy at the meeting of January 3, 1881. A French weekly (L'Illustration) has communicated this criticism to its readers under the title "Une erreur de savant allemand". Dumas, who had presented and discussed Hahn's book, first pointed out that according to Stanislas Meunier quite similar forms to that which Hahn considers to be organisms can be obtained through artificial means. Mr. Dumas seems to have succeeded in convincing the Academy of the incorrectness of Hahn's view because "L'Illustration" speaks of a “succès de rires unanimes”.

I mention here that I had the opportunity and still have the opportunity at any moment to examine several splendid specimens of organisms (3) on thin sections of the Tieschitz meteorite of Moravia (July 15, 1878) so that I am not accused of incompletely representing the "too little" photographic tables of Hahn's work.

Dr. Otto Hahn describes the chondrites as a "felt of animals, a fabric whose meshes were all living beings"; Dr. Weinland recognizes in the inclusions in question, which can be referred to as "chondren" with Gümbel, likewise "undoubted animal remains". In order to give all those who have not read Hahn's work a small idea of the ambiguity of these "animal remains" right from the outset, I note here that most of the "animals" were thought to be plants not long ago by Dr. Hahn!

On page 20 of his work, Dr. Hahn establishes the conditions in whose fulfillment is, in his opinion, the proof of the organic nature of the chondrules. These conditions are:

1\. A closed form.  
2\. A recurring form.  
3\. Recurrence of form in stages of development.  
4\. Structure (cells or vessels)  
5\. Similarity with known forms.  

As far as the "closed" form is concerned, the word "closed" is supposed to indicate a specific outline consistent with the structure. For the "organisms" of the Tieschitz meteorites I must deny a closed form in this sense.

The "recurring" of the same form cannot provide an argument in assessing the organic or inorganic nature of the chondrules. Many microscopic mineral inclusions show "closed" and "recurring" forms without supposing the odds and ends of organisms in them.

Regarding the "recurrence of form in stages of development", I strongly say that there are no "stages of development" in the sense that Dr. Hahn takes, they do not exist and cannot not serve. It cannot be denied that a transitional series can be created between the structureless and the more complex forms of the chondrules; however, the resulting developmental series cannot be called a phylogenetic one (in the sense of organic science), and if Dr. Hahn lets crinoids emerge from the corals and the sponges "through the multiplication of the canals", then this is a process which is completely incompatible with what we know about the phylogeny and ontogeny of protozoa, coelenterata, and echinoderms. It is precisely the "uniform" type of meteoritic organisms, highlighted on page 33 of Hahn's work, and the fact that all the forms can be placed in a transitional series that seem to me to constitute important arguments against the organic nature of the chondrules. Which zoologist or paleontologist would see a uniform type in sponges, corals, and crinoids?

The "structure" of the chondrules, on the whole, reminds one of certain tube corals and, if one wants to be lenient, one can forgive the layman for the confusion with the terrestrial Favosites. Some chondrules show no structure; these are considered the most primitive and Dr. Hahn, as well as Dr. Weinland, take for sponges. If a structure with more or less radial columns is noticed, especially if there are also transverse partitions (which is not always the case), then there arises an "undoubted" tube coral. If a central longitudinal channel passes through the transversely dividing columns, the "undoubted" crinoid is good to go. The development is sometimes so rapid that a sponge directly forms a crinoid. Such an advancement was made, for example, in the specimen depicted by Dr. Hahn in Table 30: Figure 5; it is an "undoubted" crinoid who, with all the pride of a parvenu, can look back to the dark days when he lived as a "sponge" in the collection of Dr. Hahn. Gümbel compared the structure of the chondrules, which I want to call "favositoid", with the structure of hailstones, a comparison that can be called apt in every respect. The excentricity of the radiation point of the fibers is probably the rule, but I found an inclusion in the Tieschitz meteorite in which the fibers meet within the sphere. I was also able to confirm several times the observation of Gümbel that in some pellets (chondrules) "there are several radiating systems with different directions" and thus a "seeming confused, stem structure" comes to light. The favositoid structure of the chondrules is only one of their formations with the "columnar" structure, which also occurs in other inclusions of the chondrites; the latter I could observe in a feldspar (?), whose rectilinear outlines are quite clearly recognizable; the slats, respective columns, are probably not radially arranged, but are particularly interesting because in the middle of several are found noticable round glass inclusions arranged in a longitudinal row. Such small inclusions seem to be thought of as perforations analogous to those found on the tube walls of the Favosites. Sometimes the individual roundish droplets blur into an apparent channel passing through the center of the column. The supposed wall openings can also be found where no transverse partitions divide the "coral tube". The transverse partitions can be seen very often and, where they are developed, reveal themselves by the irregularity and indeterminacy of their appearance as simple transverse vents, as I could observe them in macroscopic formations of the enstatite of Zdjar and in the tourmaline columns of Rozna in Moravia. It is impossible to consider the "transverse partitions" of the chondrules as real transverse walls formed by organic activity and analogous to the dissepiments of terrestrial corals. Gümbel, who is familiar with micropaleontological investigations, would certainly have recognized the organic structure of the "fine tranversely segmented fibers", if one were dealing with such phenomenon at all.

As far as the similarity of the chondrules with known forms is concerned, at most it is an external one. Can an object, which if first declared to be a plant, then a sea sponge, and finally a crinoid resemble a "known form"? I am confident that nobody, not even Proteus, could form a clear presentation.
