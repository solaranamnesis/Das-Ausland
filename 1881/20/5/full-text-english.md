# About the "Organisms of the Meteorites".

## By Anton Rzehak in Brünn.

When Dr. Otto Hahn's work "The Meteorite and its Organisms" came into my hands last year I was well aware of the importance that the detection of unquestionable organisms in meteorites would have for cosmology. After reading the above work, however, I had to confess to myself that the proof had not yet been provided with the desirable certainty; I believe I arouse the same opinion in my auditorium when, at the March meeting of the Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn, I spoke about Dr. Hahn's work.

I did not originally intend to announce in this way the view that I had formed about the "organisms" of the meteorites; I thought to myself that the professional circles would, anyway, form their independent judgement and lay people would rarely get their hands on Hahn's book because of its high price due to its furnishings. I am prompted by the article published in No. 16 of this journal by Dr. Fr. Weinland under the title "Corals in the Meteorites".

The only criticism of Hahn's work that has come to my attention thus far is the one come up with by the French Academy at the meeting of January 3, 1881. A French weekly (L'Illustration) has communicated this criticism to its readers under the title "Une erreur de savant allemand". Dumas, who had presented and discussed Hahn's book, first pointed out that according to Stanislas Meunier quite similar forms to that which Hahn considers to be organisms can be obtained through artificial means. Mr. Dumas seems to have succeeded in convincing the Academy of the incorrectness of Hahn's view because "L'Illustration" speaks of a “succès de rires unanimes”.

I mention here that I had the opportunity and still have the opportunity at any moment to examine several splendid specimens of organisms (3) on thin sections of the Tieschitz meteorite of Moravia (July 15, 1878) so that I am not accused of incompletely representing the "too little" photographic tables of Hahn's work.

Dr. Otto Hahn describes the chondrites as a "felt of animals, a fabric whose meshes were all living beings"; Dr. Weinland recognizes in the inclusions in question, which can be referred to as "chondren" with Gümbel, likewise "undoubted animal remains". In order to give all those who have not read Hahn's work a small idea of the ambiguity of these "animal remains" right from the outset, I note here that most of the "animals" were thought to be plants not long ago by Dr. Hahn!
