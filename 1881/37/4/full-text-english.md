# Once Again the "Organisms of the Meteorite"

## By Anton Rzehak

I am at a loss as to whether or not it is an advantage for science if the representatives of it display a certain indifference towards literary works that can be easily misinterpreted. "_Qui tacet, consentire videtur_"; according to this tenet the vast public is swayed and empowers the most audacious hypothesis, and unless no objections are raised from an authoritative side it will turn into a dogma. While the academic is content to allow a degree of likelihood, the common person with justice and by right may request enquiries into genuine truth; the entire complicated apparatus of scientific research and activity, the many faceted merging and interaction of the different specialities is to him completely foreign. Such achievements, which grab the general curiosity, will become before long well-known and consequently for all the educated "of this day and age" it will become invaluable scientific research preserved in the pantry "for household use". The contact between scholars and the public is in most cases mediated only through daily journalism; the mediator is in general unable to apply the standard of academic critique itself, it nevertheless must still aspire to factually satisfy the needs of the public. And so every now and then they pick from the tree of science a fruit and offer it up for enjoyment, without even considering whether or not this fruit is ripe and edible. It is in this way that different views happen to become disseminated, about which scholars have by no means become agreed, and accepted as _bona fide_ facts by the public. And so it was with the "organisms of the meteorite"; the "discovery" of the gentleman Dr. Hahn has been talked about in numerous publications without any critique and seems ready to become quite popular, even before it is confirmed or refuted by a qualified side.
