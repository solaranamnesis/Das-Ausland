# Yet Again the "Organisms of the Meteorite"

## By Anton Rzehak

I am at a loss as to whether or not it is an advantage for science if the representatives of it display a certain indifference towards literary works that can be easily misinterpreted. "_Qui tacet, consentire videtur_"; according to this tenet the vast public is swayed and empowers the most audacious hypothesis, and unless no objections are raised from an authoritative side it will turn into a dogma. While the academic is content to allow a degree of likelihood, the common person with justice and by right may request enquiries into genuine truth; the entire complicated apparatus of scientific research and activity, the many faceted merging and interaction of the different specialities is to him completely foreign. Such achievements, which grab the general curiosity, will become before long well-known and consequently to all the educated "of this day and age" it will become invaluable scientific research preserved in the pantry "for household use". The contact between scholars and the public is in most cases mediated only through daily journalism; the mediator is in general unable to apply the standard of academic critique itself, it nevertheless must still aspire to factually satisfy the needs of the public. And so every now and then they pick from the tree of science a fruit and offer it up for enjoyment, without even considering whether or not this fruit is ripe and edible. It is in this way that different views happen to become disseminated, about which scholars have by no means become agreed, and accepted as _bona fide_ facts by the public. And so it was with the "organisms of the meteorite"; the "discovery" of Dr. Hahn has been talked about in numerous publications without any critique and seems ready to become quite popular, even before it is confirmed or refuted by a qualified side. So far _pro als contra_ have been advanced by only a few voices, even though the issue is undeniably of profound significance for the entire monistic weltanschauung. The possibility of organized structures existing in the meteorites is by no means excluded from the start and this claim should be asserted not only with likelihood but with certainty, arrived at by a professional near to the matter whose duty is to undergo a neutral critique without bias. How has it come to be that in general one shies from openly expressing their judgement on such an interesting question? One is involuntarily reminded of the anxiousness with which scholars at the beginning of this century sought notions to evade Chladni's assertion about the origin of the meteorites. People alleged at the time that, "Chladni had merely thrown out a paradoxical notion, and with all imaginable pretexts they rigged up a way around and, once the physicists seriously followed suit, made fun of it." Perhaps there are similar anxieties regarding the Hahnian "discovery"; however, do you believe that the spawn of amateurs can be rendered harmless by just completely ignoring it?

Years ago Dr. Jenzsch, a counsellor of mines and the forerunner of Dr. Hahn, believed that he had discovered the fossil remains of organisms in melaphyritic and porphyritic rocks; although he did not whimsically arrive at corals and crinoids, he mentioned obtaining perfectly well-preserved algae, infusoria, and rotifers. J. G. Bornemann, at the Nature Research Assembly of Dresden (1868), reviewed and determined "that amongst all the alleged animal and plant remains not the slightest could be found, the structures should have been interpreted in a natural way as inorganic apparitions and as having arisen in a clear physical manner." Can one blame Bornemann, lest he hold it beneath his dignity to verify the views of Jenzsch? Certainly Not!

Dr. Hahn is no longer isolated in his view; he has found in Dr. Weinland a defender, who has further convinced a german paleontologist, whose name regrettably was kept secret, of the zoomorphic nature of the chondrules. It is therefore advisable under these circumstances to engage in the impartial examination of the matter and with this I myself call for anyone who has the chance to scrutinize thin sections of chondrites.
