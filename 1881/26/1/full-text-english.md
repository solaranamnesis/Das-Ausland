# More About the Animal Remains in the Meteorites.

## Dr. D. F. Weinland.

The critical remarks by Mr. A. Rzehak from Brünn published in No. 20 of this journal about the organisms of the meteorites, prompts me to say more on this matter, since Mr. Rzehak explicitly refers to my memo about "Corals in the Meteorites" in No. 16 of this body.

It is highly understandable that, as soon as a "stone" is concerned, the mineralogist initially upholds his right to it and claims the interpretation of its origin, as well as its form, to a larger or lesser extent, as his task. No one will deny him this, and as long as he comes to a clear, scientifically understandable explanation, everyone will gladly like to believe the same. But as soon as the mineralogical interpretation of a "stone" becomes very difficult, as is admitted of the chondrules in the meteorites by all sides, the danger of an artificial, forced interpretation is very near, while perhaps another scientific discipline could give a very natural, and the only correct, explanation. Let's think about the history of petrefact studies. After all, it was not so long ago that people tried to explain the fossilized remains of animals, precisely because they were stones, in all possible ways, even as "natural fixtures", but never in the most natural and correct way — until zoology took the matter into its own hands and created paleontology and, as we know, not without initial violent contradictions. Just think of the "rires unanimes" of the French Academy, appealed to by Mr. Rzehak, when at the beginning of this century Cuvier established fossilized elephants. It will be the same with the chondrite meteorites and their inclusions. Not ten years will pass before we will have a small, universally recognized fauna of the meteorites. This may still seem like a venturesome word today, but my peers, who have known me for twenty-five years, will probably know that I do not easily pronounce my conviction. — But to the point.

Dr. Hahn's meteorite work, based on hundreds of meteorite cuts, stemming from eighteen different meteorites, called by one of the foremost German authorities Professor R. as "the interpretation one wants, an excellent work of great scientific value", Mr. Rzehak from Brünn tries to briefly dismiss, referring to a French mineralogist who once also wrote about meteorites and, of course, Dr. Hahn, the "savant allemand" who, although a universally recognized capable mineralogist and excellent microscopist, is not actually a professional expert in the profession but could not readily prove the insufficiency of his observations or, especially, of his illustrations. Then Mr. Rzehak points to his own observations on a few meteorite cuts from the fall of Tieschitz in Moravia, in which he believes he has found all the material needed to declare the entire work of Dr. Hahn as _ad absurdum_. —

Certainly every expert first approached this work with great doubts. The matter came too suddenly. Some of the forms depicted by Hahn had to be immediately recognized by every connoisseur of the microscopic as typically organic animal structures, but their origin triggered a reminder to be cautious. Thus, as far as we know, no German researcher has dared to pronounce an unconditional positive or negative judgement, especially in public, merely their opinions of the work, without viewing the objects themselves. —
