# More About the Animal Remains in the Meteorites.

## Dr. David Friedrich Weinland.

The critical remarks by Mr. Anton Rzehak from Brünn, published in No. 20 of this journal, about the organisms of the meteorites prompts me to say more on this matter, since Mr. Rzehak explicitly refers to my memo about corals in the meteorites in No. 16 of this body.

It is highly understandable that, as soon as a "stone" is concerned, the mineralogist initially upholds his right to it and claims the interpretation of its origin as well as its form, to a larger or lesser extent, as his task. No one will deny him this, and as long as he comes to a clear, scientifically understandable explanation, everyone will gladly like to believe the same. But as soon as the mineralogical interpretation of a "stone" becomes very difficult, as is admitted of the chondrules in the meteorites by all sides, the danger of an artificial, forced interpretation is very near, while perhaps another scientific discipline could give a very natural, and the only correct, explanation. Let's think about the history of petrefact studies. After all, it was not so long ago that people tried to explain the fossilized remains of animals, precisely because they were stones, in all possible ways, even as "natural inclusions", but never in the most natural and correct way — until zoology took the matter into its own hands and created paleontology and, as we know, not without initial violent contradictions. Just think of the "unanimous laughter" of the French Academy, appealed to by Mr. Rzehak, when at the beginning of this century Cuvier established fossilized elephants. It will be the same with the chondrite meteorites and their inclusions. Not ten years will pass before we will have a small universally recognized fauna of the meteorites. This may still seem like a venturesome statement today, but my peers, who have known me for twenty-five years, will probably know that I do not easily pronounce my conviction. — But to the point.

Dr. Hahn's meteorite work, based on hundreds of meteorite cuts, stemming from eighteen different meteorites, called by one of the foremost German authorities Professor R. as "the interpretation one wants, an excellent work of great scientific value", Mr. Rzehak from Brünn tries to briefly dismiss, referring to a French mineralogist who once also wrote about meteorites and, of course, Dr. Hahn, the "German savant" who, although a universally recognized capable mineralogist and excellent microscopist, is not actually a professional expert in his profession but could neither readily prove the insufficiency of Hahn's observations nor, especially, of his illustrations. Then Mr. Rzehak points to his own observations on a few meteorite cuts from the fall of Tieschitz in Moravia, in which he believes he has found all the material needed to declare the entire work of Dr. Hahn as _ad absurdum_. —

Certainly every expert first approached this work with great doubts. The matter came too suddenly. Some of the forms depicted by Hahn had to be immediately recognized by every connoisseur of the microscopic as typically organic animal structures, but their origin triggered a reminder to be cautious. Thus, as far as we know, no German researcher has dared to pronounce an unconditional positive or negative judgement, especially in public, merely their opinions of the work, without viewing the objects themselves. —

The above-mentioned notice in "Ausland" about corals in the meteorites was written by me when I had only studied a few, especially desirable cuts. Since then I have had at my disposal for months the rich meteorite collection of Dr. Hahn, and I have not only had the opportunity to study the pieces pictured by him, but also a large number of new pieces, which are especially far-reaching for the zoologist. The fact that in the chondrite meteorites, some less, others more, we are dealing with a multitude of organic inclusions and indeed, from very different families and classes, of related animal detritus is beyond reproach. A brief compilation of the results from my previous studies, in which I characterize a number of genera and species, which will include some illustrations, is to be published in the Leopoldina during the summer and is already in this academy. A larger work for the Acta of the same academy, with detailed structural descriptions and drawings is in preparation. I could refer to these two, but in our fast-paced times we do not like to be consoled with the future, so I allow myself to mention a few things here, but I expressly anticipate that my position in the matter is completely impartial and that in my interpretation of the forms and the results I do not feel in any way bound by the earlier interpretations of Dr. Hahn in his meteorite work or his conclusions, about which I have talked with Dr. Hahn and completely communicated the zoological treatment of his discovery. For me, from the outset, it was only a question of: are the structures in question organic forms, what kind are they in comparison with the terrestrial ones, and what direct conclusions do their presence in the meteorites indicate about their origin?

Now several points:

1\. The various chondrite meteorites are not equally rich in their organic structures, some consist of two-thirds or more of them. As a rule, there are smaller or larger fragments and usually only after working through a large number of cuts does one find a unity out of the different structures, just as it is known even with rare terrestrial petrefacts. "Magnificent specimens of organisms", as Mr. Rzehak finds them in his first and only Moravian cuts, are unfortunately quite rare. We only have a dozen of them in six hundred cuts. By such, I mean, above all, those forms in which a large part of the external contours of the animal organism comes to view simultaneously with the internal structure. For example I have found a sponge shape, and precisely this one in a number of pieces where not only the outer shape, which is a flat-bottomed and rounded-off lobe, and also by accidental, fortunate cuts, ones where the porous covering layer of the sponge from above and generally the mesh skeleton of the gastrovascular system filling the sponge is perfectly preserved, as well as in any terrestrial petrefact. I intend I to call these forms — with the permission of Mr. Rzehak, who does not seem to particularly like my genus name Hahnia — Pectiscus. Other sponge forms, likewise in large numbers but with different, finer covering layers and other very strange star-shaped mesh gastrovascular systems, I will propose to leave the name Urania that Dr. Hahn originally created for this form, of course, as when he used to think all these structures as plants, for which Mr. Rzehak takes so much offense, but perhaps my dear friend Dr. Hahn would rather apologize when he remembers that at the beginning of this century the sponges were declared as plants by many proficient researchers. I would like to add here that for Dr. Hahn, as he expressly explains in his book, the zoological classification of his forms was not the main concern and count not be, because he is not an expert in zoology. His only concern was to prove that there are organic formations in the meteorites and this is, and will remain, his great and meaningful merit, though with his zoological interpretations, especially that of the crinoids, etc., I cannot follow everywhere he wants to go.
