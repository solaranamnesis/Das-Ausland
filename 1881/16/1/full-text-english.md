# Corals in the Meteorites

## by Dr. D. Fr. Weinland

The question of whether or not other celestial bodies besides our Earth are inhabited or were inhabited by living beings is certainly one of the most interesting that exists for the thinking human being and could, in all probability, already be affirmed. The quite analogous physical conditions, as demonstrated by some of the other planets in our Solar System, and as they probably demonstrate the countless planets of other star systems, suggests with some certainty that not on our Earth alone has a higher organic process of development taken place. But this was always only an analogy, a hypothesis, however well supported.
